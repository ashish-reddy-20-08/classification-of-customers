# classification-of-customers
- In this project we classify the customers using **K-Means clustering**.
- Classification of customers based on the spending score, annual income, age, gender and trying to group the customers who belong to a particular category. 
- I have used the K Means clustering technique here and grouped the customers. 
- K-Means clustering is a algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar           properties.
- I have used visualization techniques like Distplot, count plot, violin plot, barplot, replot, scatter plot. 
- While I was working on the dataset I have found that the relation between the annual income and spending score makes the perfect way to classify the customers and I have       divided them based on this taking the K value as 5. 

## What is K-Means clustering?

K-Means Clustering is a simple yet powerful algorithm in data science

 There are a plethora of real-world applications of K-Means Clustering (a few of which we will cover here)


## How does the K-Means Algorithm Work?

The working of the K-Means algorithm is explained in the below steps:

Step-1: Select the number K to decide the number of clusters.

Step-2: Select random K points or centroids. (It can be other from the input dataset).

Step-3: Assign each data point to their closest centroid, which will form the predefined K clusters.

Step-4: Calculate the variance and place a new centroid of each cluster.

Step-5: Repeat the third steps, which means reassign each datapoint to the new closest centroid of each cluster.

Step-6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step-4 else go to FINISH.

Step-7: The model is ready.


## Applications of Clustering in Real-World Scenarios

Clustering is a widely used technique in the industry. 

It is actually being used in almost every domain, ranging from banking to recommendation engines, document clustering to image segmentation.

**Customer Segmentation**

one of the most common applications of clustering is customer segmentation. And it isnâ€™t just limited to banking. This strategy is across functions, including telecom, e-commerce, sports, advertising, sales, etc.

**Document Clustering**
