# classification-of-customers
- In this project we classify the customers using **K-Means clustering**.
- Classification of customers based on the spending score, annual income, age, gender and trying to group the customers who belong to a particular category. 
- I have used the K Means clustering technique here and grouped the customers. 
- I have used visualization techniques like Distplot, count plot, violin plot, barplot, replot, scatter plot. 
- While I was working on the dataset I have found that the relation between the annual income and spending score makes the perfect way to classify the customers and I have       divided them based on this taking the K value as 5.
